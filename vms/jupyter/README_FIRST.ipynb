    "# Unidata JupyterHub Server on the NSF Jetstream Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a notebook on this JupyterHub server, you should be dropped down into the correct kernel. However, if you try to execute one of the notebooks and get errors, it's possible the notebook is running under the wrong kernel. In JupyterLab, the kernel takes care of loading the correct code interpreter (a version of python, in the case of the Unidata notebooks) as well as all software modules required for the notebook to run. In general, you'll want to run a notebook in the kernel that corresponds to the top-level folder in shown on the left side of the JupyterLab screen. For example, if you're running one of the notebooks under the notebook-gallery folder (e.g.,  [Miller Composite Notebook](notebook-gallery/notebooks/miller_composite.ipynb)), choose the kernel marked Python `[conda env:notebook-gallery]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To change the kernel, select `Kernel → Change kernel...` from the menu on the JupyterLab screen. The kernel that is currently in use is displayed in the upper right corner of the the JupyterLab screen; you can also click on that display to select a different kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geoscientific Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "With this JupyterHub server, you can explore and run pre-installed Unidata Python notebooks. We have three notebook projects available which you can find in the JupyterLab folder view on the left:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unidata Python Workshop\n",
    "- Unidata Notebook Gallery\n",
    "- Unidata Online Python Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Therein you can find geoscientific notebooks to experiment with or to use as example templates for your own notebooks. We already preloaded all the software dependencies you will need to run these notebooks. In addition, you can create your own notebooks, folders, projects, conda environments, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, you will be fetching data from a well known server and accessing the data through the [Siphon API](https://unidata.github.io/siphon/latest/) with something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from siphon.simplewebservice.wyoming import WyomingUpperAir\n",
    "df = WyomingUpperAir.request_data(request_time, args.site)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, you may have data on your local computer or elsewhere you would like to analyze. There are a few different options in this scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Upload Data \n",
    "\n",
    "The JupyterHub server along with JupyterLab has [upload capability](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/files.html#uploading-and-downloading). There are roughly 10 GB of local storage available to store data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Command Line Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This JupyterHub is equipped `wget` and `curl` and are available via the Terminal. If your data are URL accessible, you can fetch them with these command line tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. RAMADDA\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming your data are netCDF CF, upload your data to a [RAMADDA server](https://ramadda.scigw.unidata.ucar.edu/repository) (contact us if you need a login) and grab the OpenDAP URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Contact Us\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data you have in mind are case study data, for a class for example, we can ensure the data are already available inside your Jupyter environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a rather full-fledged Linux Terminal (`File → New → Terminal`) also available. There are a few reasons why you may wish to use the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git` version control capability\n",
    "- create new conda environments (see next item)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Additional Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create additional kernels and have them be available via the kernel menu. Your kernel must contain the `nb_conda_kernels` and `ipykernel` packages for this to work. For example, if you wish to have a kernel with the `seaborn` package, you can create the following `environment.yml` from the terminal with the `pico` editor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    " name: myenv\n",
    " channels:\n",
    "   - conda-forge\n",
    " dependencies:\n",
    "   - python=3\n",
    "   - seaborn\n",
    "   - nb_conda_kernels\n",
    "   - ipykernel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "followed by\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda env update --name myenv -f environment.yml`\n",
    "\n",
    "at this point `myenv` will be available via the `Kernel → Change kernel...` menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveat emptor\n",
    "\n",
    "When you log in to the Unidata JupyterHub server, you are automatically granted a 10 GB data storage volume. You are free to use this storage for your own notebooks and accompanying data. These resources should persist each time you login, but be aware this system is still under development. The data storage volume created for you is not guaranteed to persist indefinitely. If losing any resources you create in the Unidata JupyterHub environment would be a significant inconvenience, please make backup copies of your work. Notebooks, for example, can be easily downloaded by right-clicking on the file name in the file browser on the left side of the JupyterLab interface and selecting `Download` from the pop-up menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mailing List\n",
    "\n",
    "Please sign up to our mailing list to be made aware of developments and down times. Subscribe at:  [jupyter-jetstream+subscribe@ucar.edu](mailto:jupyter-jetstream+subscribe@ucar.edu).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Issues and Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Email support questions to [support-gateway@unidata.ucar.edu](mailto:support-gateway@unidata.ucar.edu). Feedback is important: it will help us move forward faster together!"
