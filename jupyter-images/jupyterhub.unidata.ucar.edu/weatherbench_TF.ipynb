We will walk you through all the code so if you are not familiar with python you can simply click through the code boxes (see \"How to run this exercise\" below).

Follow the instructions below to connect to a GPU. After that you can run each block of code by selecting shift+control repeatedly, or by selecting the \"play\" icon. \n",
