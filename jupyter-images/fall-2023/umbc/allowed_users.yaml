# When there are a lot of users we keep secrets.yaml short by using a separate
# file (this file) for the allow list. To ensure this file is read by
# JupyterHub, add the `--values allowed_users.yaml` option to the `helm upgrade`
# command in `install_jhub.sh`.
# 
# IMPORTANT: As you'll likely copy and paste usernames from a spreadsheet onto
# here, ensure that all usernames consist of only lower-case characters. See:
# https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/spawner-unnecessarily-encoding-capital-letters-leading-to-pvc-creation-errors-and-jhub-crash/17704
#
# You can do this in vim by selecting a block of text in Visual Line mode (`V`),
# selecting the appropriate lines, then using the `gu` command
