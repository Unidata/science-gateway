# allowed_users.yaml template that has Unidata employees' github usernames
# 
# There will be a lot of users, so we keep secrets.yaml short by using a
# separate file (this file) for the allow list. It is passed to helm via
# ./install_jhub.sh
#
# IMPORTANT: As you'll likely copy and paste usernames from a spreadsheet onto
# here, ensure that all usernames consist of only lower-case characters.
# You can do this in vim by selecting a block of text in Visual Line mode
# (`V`), selecting the appropriate lines, then using the `gu` command
