  :END:

Welcome to the [[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/][Unidata]] Science Gateway on the National Science Foundation [[https://portal.xsede.org/jetstream][Jetstream Cloud]]. Unidata is a diverse community of education and research institutions with the common goal of sharing geoscience data and the tools to access and visualize that data. For more than 30 years, Unidata has been providing data, software tools, and support to enhance Earth-system education and research. Funded primarily by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Unidata is one of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR)'s Community Programs (UCP).

As part of our current [[https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/publications/directorspage/proposals/2024_proposal_narrative_final.pdf][five-year plan (PDF)]] "Unidata 2024: Next-generation Data Services and Workflows to Advance Geoscience Research and Education", Unidata is exploring cloud computing technologies in the context of accessing, analyzing, and visualizing geoscience data. This site collects Unidata-related technologies hosted on Jetstream; you can make use of these resources either directly in your browser or using one of the client applications described below. Our hope is that by combining the resources available in this gateway -- and perhaps coupling them with XSEDE HPC resources -- community members can create end-to-end scientific computing workflows in the Jetstream Cloud.

* JupyterHub

  :CUSTOM_ID: h-D1710E1B
  :END:

[[https://jupyterhub.unidata.ucar.edu][JupyterHub server on Jetstream]] ([[https://github.com/][GitHub login]] required)

This JupyterHub is now open to anyone with an [[https://github.com][GitHub login]]. Also please sign up to our mailing list to be made aware of developments and down times. Subscribe at:  [[mailto:jupyter-jetstream+subscribe@ucar.edu][jupyter-jetstream+subscribe@ucar.edu]]. After logging in, please read the =README_FIRST.ipynb= notebook that is periodically updated with relevant information concerning this JupyterHub installation.

[[https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io][JupyterHub]] is a technology that can serve programmatic, interactive notebooks to a class of students or for scientific researchers. The [[https://jupyterhub.unidata.ucar.edu][Unidata JupyterHub server]] running on Jetstream contains three Unidata Jupyter notebook projects:

- [[https://github.com/Unidata/unidata-python-workshop][Unidata Python Workshop]]
- [[https://github.com/Unidata/notebook-gallery][Unidata Notebook Gallery]]
- [[https://github.com/Unidata/online-python-training][Unidata Online Python Training]]

* THREDDS Data Server
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h-9690244B
  :END:

 [[https://tds.scigw.unidata.ucar.edu/thredds/catalog.html][TDS installation on Jetstream]]

The Unidata [[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/][THREDDS Data server]] (TDS) is a web server that provides metadata and data access for scientific datasets, using a variety of remote data access protocols. A [[https://tds.scigw.unidata.ucar.edu/thredds/catalog.html][TDS]] is available on Jetstream at ~https://tds.scigw.unidata.ucar.edu/thredds/catalog.xml~ supplying a good portion of the data available on the [[http://rtstats.unidata.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/rtstats/rtstats_summary_volume?idd-relay.jetstream-cloud.org+GRAPH][IDD]] with a five day archive.

This TDS can be accessed from the  [[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/][IDV]] or from Python with the [[https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf4-python][netCDF-Python]] or [[https://github.com/Unidata/siphon][Siphon]] APIs or any THREDDS client (e.g., PyCSW).

* THREDDS AWS Nexrad Server
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h-6B491DAA
  :END:

[[http://thredds-aws.unidata.ucar.edu/thredds/catalog.html][THREDDS AWS Nexrad Installation on Jetstream]]

In collaboration with the [[https://www.noaa.gov/big-data-project][NOAA Big Data Project]] and Amazon Web Services (AWS), Unidata has deployed a THREDDS AWS Nexrad Server on the Jetstream Cloud. More than twenty years of [[https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-nexrad/][Nexrad Level II]] data are available from this server. The data reside on AWS, but are served out by a THREDDS Data server running on Jetstream.

* AWIPS EDEX
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h-9ADDB20C
  :END:

EDEX installation on Jetstream: ~edex-cloud.unidata.ucar.edu~

AWIPS is a meteorological display and analysis system used by the National Weather Service.  [[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/awips2/][EDEX]] is the server-side component of this system. Unidata maintains an EDEX data server on Jetstream to ingest and serve real-time AWIPS data for rendering by the [[http://unidata.github.io/awips2/install/install-cave/][CAVE client]] and the [[http://python-awips.readthedocs.io][python-awips data access framework]].  For CAVE, simply enter ~edex-cloud.unidata.ucar.edu~ in the CAVE Connectivity Preferences dialog to connect.

* RAMADDA Geoscience CMS
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h-DBF62CF5
  :END:

[[https://ramadda.scigw.unidata.ucar.edu/repository][RAMADDA installation on Jetstream]]

[[https://geodesystems.com/][RAMADDA]] is a geoscience content management system (CMS) originally developed at Unidata and now maintained by [[http://geodesystems.com/][Geode Systems]]. The [[https://ramadda.scigw.unidata.ucar.edu/repository][RAMADDA installation on Jetstream]] contains [[https://ramadda.scigw.unidata.ucar.edu/repository/entry/show?entryid=0d0cbe65-2f39-4754-801f-a3f996693ed9][IDV bundles]] that retrieve data from Jetstream data servers.

* LDM

  :END:

[[http://rtstats.unidata.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/rtstats/rtstats_summary_volume?idd-relay.jetstream-cloud.org+GRAPH][LDM installation on Jetstream]]

The Unidata [[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ldm/][Local Data Manager]] (LDM) system is a peer-to-peer network for event-driven data distribution, and is the fundamental component of the Unidata Internet Data ([[http://rtstats.unidata.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/rtstats/rtstats_summary_volume?idd-relay.jetstream-cloud.org+GRAPH][IDD]]) system. Two *internal* LDM nodes supply data to our Jetstream resources.

* ADDE
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h-4AD59494
  :END:

ADDE installation on Jetstream: ~adde://adde.scigw.unidata.ucar.edu:112~

[[https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/doc/learn_guide/2015/adde.html][ADDE]] (Abstract Data Distribution Environment) is a data server developed by the University of Wisconsin, Space Science Engineering Center. It primarily serves satellite and radar imagery and point observations to the  [[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/][IDV]], [[http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/software/v/][McIDAS-V]], [[https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/][McIDAS-X]]. An ADDE server is available at ~adde.scigw.unidata.ucar.edu~ over (the usual) port ~112~.

* IDV Resources
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h-D0BA253D
  :END:

The [[https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/][Unidata Integrated Data Viewer]] (IDV) is a desktop application for viewing data in two and three dimensions. It excels at bringing together geoscience data from disparate sources into one integrated display.

** Running the IDV on Jetstream
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-D76F2C8F
   :END:

For those who have a Jetstream allocation (e.g., startup, education, research), an IDV image is available when selecting VMs through the [[https://use.jetstream-cloud.org/application/images][Jetstream Atmosphere dashboard]]. If you do not have a Jetstream allocation, it is possible to obtain a [[https://iujetstream.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JWT/pages/76150553/Get+a+Jetstream+Trial+Access+account][Jetstream Trial Access account]]. When searching for images, search for "IDV". You will find the =Unidata IDV <version>= image. Launching that image will then allow you to "Open Web Desktop" where the IDV will be available pre-loaded with the Jetstream plugin. The catalogs available via the IDV Dashboard, Data Choosers will default to the TDS and RAMADDA servers running on Jetstream enabling data-proximate performance, especially for large datasets. You can also select image sizes that are appropriate to your goals. For example, if working with a data intensive bundle, you could choose an m1.medium VM with 6 vCPUS, 16 GB RAM.

** IDV Jetstream Plugin
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-05438731
   :END:

The IDV Jetstream plugin allows easy access to Jetstream installations of the TDS, RAMADDA and ADDE from the IDV. The plugin URL is ~https://science-gateway.unidata.ucar.edu/jetstream.jar~. [[https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/docs/workshop/advanced/PluginManager.html][See here for how to install an IDV plugin from a URL]].
