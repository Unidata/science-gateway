Welcome to the Unidata Science Gateway. [[https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/][Unidata]] is a diverse community of education and research institutions with the common goal of sharing geoscience data and the tools to access and visualize that data. For more than 30 years, Unidata has been providing data, software tools, and support to enhance Earth-system education and research. Funded primarily by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Unidata is one of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR)'s Community Programs (UCP).  
  
The Unidata Science Gateway unites Unidata technologies with the [[https://jetstream-cloud.org/][NSF Jetstream cloud computing platform]] and open-source software such as [[https://jupyter.org/][Project Jupyter]] to provide the academic and research community an environment they can employ to access, analyze and visualize real-time and case study Earth system science data. The Unidata Science Gateway is a virtual space where communities can collaborate, share resources, and learn from each other in a classroom or workshop setting.

The Unidata Science Gateway employs a collection of data distribution and serving technologies to provide data to a variety of analysis and visualization applications both within and outside the gateway. The Unidata Science Gateway receives real-time data through the [[https://rtstats.unidata.ucar.edu/rtstats/][LDM/IDD peer-to-peer data transfer system]]. Once data have been ingested by the Science Gateway,  THREDDS, RAMADDA, AWIPS EDEX, and ADDE data servers supply real-time and case study data to analysis and visualization applications through a variety of well-known and standard data access and subsetting mechanisms. In addition, the Unidata Science Gateway can contain Jupyter Notebook environments pre-configured with [[https://pyaos.github.io/][PyAOS (Python for the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences)]] libraries to provide data analysis and visualization notebook environments accessible from a web browser. Data available on the Science Gateway can also be accessed from traditional geoscientific desktop applications such as the IDV, AWIPS CAVE, and McIDAS.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to remote work and learning has significantly increased use of the Unidata Science Gateway. The Unidata Science Gateway has supported workshops and semester-long classes at about a dozen universities and other institutions. It has been used to support two AMS Python workshops, IT training for [[https://soars.ucar.edu/][UCAR SOARS Protégés]] as well as for individual internship projects, and an NSF REU program at the University of Oklahoma. To date, the Unidata Science Gateway has supported over 600 students (mostly undergraduate meteorology students).

The [[https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/][Unidata Integrated Data Viewer]] (IDV) is a desktop application for viewing data in two and three dimensions. It excels at bringing together geoscience data from disparate sources into one integrated display.

** Running the IDV on Jetstream
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-D76F2C8F
   :END:

For those who have a Jetstream allocation (e.g., startup, education, research), an IDV image is available when selecting VMs through the [[https://use.jetstream-cloud.org/application/images][Jetstream Atmosphere dashboard]]. If you do not have a Jetstream allocation, it is possible to obtain a [[https://iujetstream.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JWT/pages/76150553/Get+a+Jetstream+Trial+Access+account][Jetstream Trial Access account]]. When searching for images, search for "IDV". You will find the =Unidata IDV <version>= image. Launching that image will then allow you to "Open Web Desktop" where the IDV will be available pre-loaded with the Jetstream plugin. The catalogs available via the IDV Dashboard, Data Choosers will default to the TDS and RAMADDA servers running on Jetstream enabling data-proximate performance, especially for large datasets. You can also select image sizes that are appropriate to your goals. For example, if working with a data intensive bundle, you could choose an m1.medium VM with 6 vCPUS, 16 GB RAM.
