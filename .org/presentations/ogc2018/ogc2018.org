- Most importantly for this science oriented group...
- Not only can you do science that you currently do, *faster*.
- But it should enable science not currently possible (e.g., analysis of big data).

- In short, we bang our heads against the wall so you don't have to!
- We install the difficult to install libraries and software:
  - Inside containers.
  - In the JupyterHub.
  - All of which we will discuss more in a moment.

* Docker

    :END:

- Docker is an open source platform for uniformly building, deploying and running software in the cloud.
- _Key idea_ is the expert installs software inside a so-called "container", and you deploy the container.
- Linux focused, so most applicable (but not limited) to server-side.
- Barrier to entry is low and adoption is already wide-spread.
- Industry is standardizing on Docker and building upon it.

** NOTE: What is a Dockerfile?                                       :B_note:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: note
    :CUSTOM_ID: h-4C527204
    :END:

- Containers are defined in a ~Dockerfile~.
- *Dockerfile*: Simple mini programming language for building images.
- If you know a minimal amount of Unix scripting, you already know Dockerfile syntax.
- What is really great about Dockerfiles is they codify dark knowledge.

** What Have We Containerized?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-CEFF2D21
   :END:

- Local Data Manager (LDM) Peer-to-Peer Data Transfer Package
- _THREDDS Data Server_
- McIDAS ADDE remote sensing software and server
- RAMADDA Geoscience Content Management System
- AWIPS EDEX Server
- We also *leverage a community JupyterHub* container

    :BEAMER_env: note
    :CUSTOM_ID: h-F14AABE6
    :END:

- We've containerized a suite of Unidata technologies.
- Unidata Docker containers have taken on a life of their own.
- Especially:
  - TDS
  - LDM
- A number of you in the OGC crowd should be interested in the TDS container.
- All of this is available on DockerHub or GitHub.

- What is Jetstream?
  - A National Science and Engineering Cloud funded by an $11 million NSF grant.
  - Data centers at IU and TACC.
- Attached to fast Internet2 capability.
- Cloud based on OpenStack for creation of VMs, networks etc.

- Decided to advertise these resources through one web portal.
- Called it a Science Gateway.
- A science gateway is simply a web site that "Brings Science to the Web".
- This is very much an organic, grassroots process based on previous containerization work.
- Strongly prefer open-source componentry.

- LDM receiving large quantities (33 GBs/hour) of NCEP data delivered via IDD
- THREDDS serving that IDD Data
- McIDAS ADDE serving satellite data from IDD
- RAMADDA geoscience content management system
- EDEX server for AWIPS system

- IDD: Unidata Internet Data Distribution Network.
- NCEP: National Centers for Environmental Prediction.
  - A lot of forecast model data.
- AWIPS a display and telecommunications behemoth we deploy for our academic community.
  - EDEX is the server side component of AWIPS.

    :END:

- IDV: a client application to integrate, and visualize geoscience data in two, three, and four dimensions.
- In truth, not much value added here since IDV out-of-the-box already has access to Unidata servers distributing the same data we have on Jetstream.

    :CUSTOM_ID: h-C1F0E985

- A bit more value added here since the server side component, EDEX, is a behemoth requiring lots of resources that can be accommodated by a cloud data center.

- They are available on GitHub.
- Problem: installing Jupyter with all the requisite libraries  to run these notebooks is not easy.

- Allows users to spawn their own Jupyter notebook servers.
- The JupyterHub have been pre-configured by _us_, the Unidata experts w/ necessary APIs, etc.
- This is where we really start seeing value added by running on the cloud.
- Notebooks can access data servers described earlier in data-proximate fashion.

- ~git~ utilities.
- software carpentry tools.
- Data transfer utilities.
- Very powerful b/c command lines are very powerful.

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-114173C8

- After initial testing, we would like to get more users
- Incorporate JupyterLab
- Improve authentication beyond Globus OAuth

- Collaborate with Science Gateways Community Institute (SGCI)
- Implement fail over redundancy between TACC and IU data centers for reliability
