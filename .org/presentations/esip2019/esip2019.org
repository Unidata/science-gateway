** Zero to JupyterHub Project
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-06120E7D
   :END:

_Problem_: A single JupyterHub server running on a large VM can only serve a small number of students (< 10).

_Solution_: *Zero to JupyterHub* project aims to install JupyterHub across several orchestrated VMs to accommodate many more users
  - Virtual Machines
  - Software Containers (i.e., Docker)
  - Data center software orchestration (i.e., *Kubernetes*)

_Zero to JupyterHub allows for many more users._

  - Ansible: kubernetes cluster software installation
- Added layer of scripts to streamline deployment
  - ~setup-kube.sh~
  - ~setup-kube2.sh~
- Initially, must decide on size/number of VMs via ~terraform.tf~
- Can be scaled "manually" thereafter (no autoscaling)

** Problems with JupyterHub Deployments and Maintenance
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-5EC69A7E
   :END:

- Finicky VMs during cluster creation (takes several tries)
- Timeout errors at every level (deployment and running)
- Complexity associated with software running on clusters
- JupyterHub spawn errors
- Disk allocation errors
- Network problems at TACC
- General lack of reliability throughout entire tech stack

** Spawn Errors :-(                                                :noexport:

** Additional Caveats
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-1179E568
   :END:

- What to do with user data over long term? What guarantees?
- This project is not Pangeo
  - Goals are more modest and Unidata focused
  - Would be happy to deploy Pangeo on Unidata Jetstream allocation

** Lessons Learned
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-35A87BA8
   :END:

- Scriptifying your deployments to make your life easier
- Interview your users before so cluster can be accurately sized
- Tech stack is new and fragile and will take time before it is stable
- Don't advertise too early, scale gradually by introducing to incrementally wider audiences to address problems
- Need to be persistent to overcome tech challenges: ask for help on github issues and gitter
- Science professionals have a high threshold for problems as long as they can arrive at a desired objective

** Future Plans
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h-BC28FC54
   :END:

- Get technology problems under control, don't build on a Swiss cheese foundation
- Experiment more with IU Jetstream data center
- Autoscaling on OpenStack with Zonca collaboration
- Address github issues
- Once things stabilize, promote to wider community
