* Background
** Unidata Five-Year Plan

/Transition to a remote-access "cloud" environment for geoscience data is vital to our community's ability to pursue research and education in the 21st century./
\\
-Unidata Five-year plan 2013-2018

** Forces at Play

- Data are becoming unwieldy and expensive to move
- Cloud-computing and technologies like Docker, Kubernetes etc. allow easy deployments of complex environments at scale
- Web browser is the de facto cross-platform "app".
- Economic advantages to running VMs in the cloud

** Consequences of These Forces

- Computation, visualization, analysis should be done where data live
- Workflows should be cloud-based and accessible through a web browser
- Opportunity to unify these workflows under the concept of *science gateway*

** Target Audience
- Core Unidata Community
- Atmospheric science departments and their students
- Professors and students get to _science faster_

* Jupyter
** What is Literate Programming?
*** Column 1
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.5
    :END:

- Prose, diagrams, equations _first_, code second.
- Excels at teaching and expository objectives and "executable" scientific papers.
- Despite long roots in programming, LP is finally popular thanks to *Jupyter Notebooks*.

*** Column 2
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_col: 0.5

** What is a Jupyter Notebook?
*** Column 1
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.5
    :END:

Cells of:
- Markdown
- Equations (w/ MathJax, LaTeX)
- Executable code (Python, R etc.)
- Figures

*** Column 2
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_col: 0.5

** A Tool of Thought
*** Column 1
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:

- Concept by Ken Iverson and APL programming language.
- *Foreshadowed interactive, exploratory, scientific programming*
- Instead of APL we have Python

*** Column 2
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_col: 0.6
   :END:

_APL_:
#+begin_src APL
1,↑¨+.×\N⍴⊂2 2⍴1 1 1 0
#+end_src

_Python_:
#+begin_src python
def fb(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    else:
        return fb(n-1) + fb(n-2)
#+end_src

** Success of Jupyter Notebooks

* JupyterHub as a Science Gateway Companion
** JupyterHub: Multi-user Jupyter Notebooks

*** Column 1
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.5
    :END:

- Users log in to a JupyterHub server
- Users have their own work space
- Excellent for workshops or in the classroom
- Administrator can configure ahead of time on behalf of user

*** Column 2
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_col: 0.5
   :END:

#+ATTR_LATEX: width=\textwidth

** More Than Just Notebooks

*** Column 1
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.5
    :END:
- ~git~ utilities
- software carpentry tools
- Data transfer utilities (e.g., Globus personal connect)
- Powerful b/c command lines are powerful.

*** Column 2
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_col: 0.5

** Jupyter Extensions

*** Column 1
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.5
    :END:

- Jupyter and JupyterHub can be extended by software developers
- Dozens of extensions have been written, e.g.,
- code folding
- code formatting
- Web VNC client

* Unidata Science Gateway JupyterHub
** Unidata Science Gateway JupyterHub

https://jupyter-jetstream.unidata.ucar.edu

Three PyAOS notebook projects w/ pre-configured environments:

1. Unidata Python Workshop
2. Unidata Notebook Gallery
3. Unidata Online Python Training

_67 PyAOS notebooks total_

** Pre-configured Environments

Complex environments already built w/ conda package manager

- conda environments e.g.,
  - numpy
  - netCDF4-Python
  - cartopy
  - metpy
  - xarray
  - etc.

- Select appropriate kernel from kernel menu

** JupyterHub Workflows

- Data-proximate analysis and viz:
  - LDM/IDD → THREDDS Data Server → *Jupyter Notebooks*
  - XSEDE HPC → Terminal Globus Tools → *Jupyter Notebooks*
- Remote access:
  - *JupyterHub and Notebooks* hitting  (e.g., NOMADS)

** Example 1: Satellite + GFS

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 6.5cm

** Example 2: Vorticity Advection

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 6.5cm
[[file:images/avor.png]]

** Example 3: Miller Composite

* Implementation Details, Software Carpentry
** GitHub Repository

- Collaborative development on GitHub
- https://github.com/Unidata/science-gateway
- https://github.com/Unidata/science-gateway/tree/master/vms/jupyter

** Unidata JupyterHub Docker Container

- Based on official ~jupyterhub/jupyterhub:master~
- Pre-built conda/pip environments (available via Kernel menu in Jupyter)
- Globus Personal Connect for moving data locally
- Environments are complex, take a long time to build
- Best if we do the work so you get to science faster
- Using ~docker-compose~ w/ stock ~nginx~ container

** OpenStack VM on Jetstream Cloud

- JupyterHub Deployed On Jetstream Cloud "XLarge VM" 24 CPUs  60 GB of RAM
_Caveat emptor_:
  - No Kubernetes /yet/ so will not scale to an influx of concurrent users
  - OK for a number of occasional users

** OAuth

- Leveraging other authentication systems
- Globus OAuth via XSEDE
- Need login at https://portal.xsede.org
- Configured in =jupyterhub_config.py=

** JupyterLab
*** Column 1
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.5
    :END:

- Next generation Jupyter interface
- Easier to navigate and more functionality
- Classic view still available

*** Column 2
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_col: 0.5
   :END:

** Upon First Login

- User directory space created with three notebook projects
- Responsibility then falls on the user for maintaining the projects up to date with ~git~ via the terminal
- User data (e.g., notebooks) is persisted and backed up

** Best Practices for Sharing Notebook Projects

- Ensure you have a conda =environment.yml= at the root of the notebook project
- Remember that notebooks are more than a series of code cells
- It is an expository exercise

* Future Plans
** Scaling for Cloud

- Kubernetes on Jetstream
- Continue collaboration w/ XSEDE ECSS (Semir Sarajlic and Suresh Marru)
- Andrea Zonca's Zero to JupyterHub solution (once ready)

** nbnovnc Jupyter Extension

- May solve "last mile" problem to CloudIDV
- AWIPS CAVE client also a possibility
- "Hub" in JupyterHub leveraged to solve problems beyond Jupyter

** Final Thoughts

- The technology hurdles surround JupyterHub will be solved
- Content creation will be the rate limiting step
- Domain expertise and effort required to create quality, literate programming notebooks
