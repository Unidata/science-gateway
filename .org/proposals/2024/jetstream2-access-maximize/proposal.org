** NSF Unidata Program Center
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-478F80A5
:END:

NSF Unidata[cite:@Unidata2024] is a community data facility for the atmospheric and related sciences, established in 1984 by U.S. universities with sponsorship from the U. S. National Science Foundation (NSF Award #: 2403649[cite:@nsfaward2403649]). The NSF Unidata Program Center (UPC), the program office for NSF Unidata and the nexus of activities related to NSF Unidata's mission, is managed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), a consortium of 126 member universities and academic affiliates providing science in service to society[cite:@ucarmembers2024].

NSF Unidata[cite:@unidata2024] exists to engage and serve researchers and educators dedicated to advancing the frontiers of Earth Systems Sciences (ESS). The program's aim is to help transform the conduct of research and education in atmospheric and related sciences by providing well-integrated, end-to-end data services and tools. NSF Unidata's offerings address many aspects of the scientific data lifecycle, from locating and retrieving useful data, through the process of analyzing and visualizing data either locally or remotely, to curating and sharing the results. Specifically, NSF Unidata:

- Acquires, distributes, and provides remote access to meteorological data in near real time.
- Develops software for accessing, managing, analyzing, visualizing, and effectively using ESS data.
- Provides comprehensive training and support to users of its products and services.
- In partnership with others, facilitates the advancement of tools, standards and conventions.
- Provides leadership in cyberinfrastructure and fosters adoption of new tools and techniques.
- Assesses and responds to community needs, fostering community interaction and engagement to promote sharing of data, tools, and ideas.

NSF Unidata's core community is faculty, students, and researchers in the atmospheric science departments of U.S. universities. Beyond this core, we endeavor to provide tools and data to scientists and secondary-level educators and researchers across many fields in ESS, supporting the hydrology, oceanography, and solid Earth communities (among others) both in the U.S. and worldwide.

To give a sense of the scale of NSF Unidata's services to the ESS community[cite:@unidatastatus2024]:

- Using the NSF Unidata Local Data Manager (LDM)[cite:@emmerson1994ldm], the UPC coordinates the Internet Data Distribution system (IDD), in which hundreds of universities cooperate to disseminate near real-time earth observations via the Internet. As of May 2024, the IDD encompasses 545 machines at 176 unique institutions; these sites collectively receive approximately 69 terabytes of ESS data every day.
- NSF Unidata software packages including netCDF[cite:@rew1989netcdf], MetPy[cite:@may2016metpy], AWIPS[cite:@meyer2024awips], IDV[cite:@murray1997unidataidv], LDM[cite:@emmerson1994ldm], the THREDDS Data Server (TDS)[cite:@caron1997thredds], and UDUNITS[cite:@emmerson2007udunits] give ESS researchers, educators, and students access to professional tools for data management, analysis, and visualization. All NSF Unidata software is open source and available at no cost.
- NSF Unidata's Science Gateway[cite:@ramamurthy2017sciencegateway] has leveraged Jetstream and Jetstream2 resources to provide cloud-based JupyterHub environments for "Python for Atmosphere and Ocean Science" (PyAOS). Since 2020, these JupyterHubs have supported over 1,830 students across 24 universities[cite:@Chastang2024a], regional workshops, AMS workshops[cite:@Arms2020b], and the UCAR SOARS program[cite:@Chastang2022a].
- NSF Unidata makes a version of the National Weather Service's Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) available to universities for educational use. NSF Unidata's AWIPS release is tailored to the needs of educators rather than operational weather forecasters, allowing it to be significantly smaller and easier to use. Again taking advantage of Jetstream2 resources, NSF Unidata provides a publicly-available AWIPS Environmental Data EXchange (EDEX) server, allowing students and instructors to explore the software's visualization and analysis capabilities without the need to administer a dedicated data server. Unidata's public EDEX server provides an average of 1.5 terabytes of data each day.

NSF Unidata's data distribution software packages are particularly well suited for use in a cloud-computing environment[cite:@Chastang2016]. Four such applications we will continue to focus on with this request are:

- Local Data Manager (LDM) is a peer-to-peer data distribution technology well adapted to moving large ESS datasets across computer networks in real time.
- Thematic Realtime Environmental Distributed Data Services (THREDDS) provides metadata and data access for scientific datasets, using a variety of remote data access protocols including OPeNDAP.
-  Repository for Archiving, Managing and Accessing Diverse DAta (RAMADDA)[cite:@mcwhirter2024ramadda], originally developed at NSF Unidata and now maintained at Geode Systems, is a content management system for ESS data. It has excellent integration with the NSF Unidata Integrated Data Viewer (IDV) visualization tool.
- The AWIPS Environmental Data EXchange is a data server that allows AWIPS visualization and analysis components to efficiently display and analyze a variety of data.

The LDM, THREDDS, RAMADDA, and AWIPS are proven, robust technologies that have matured over many years of development and use by academic and broader ESS communities. They are capable of distributing very large volumes of forecast model output, climate datasets, satellite and radar imagery, lightning, surface observational and upper-air data, textual weather bulletins, and many other ESS data types in near real-time.

Beyond our data distribution and serving technologies, NSF Unidata also facilitates the analysis and visualization of data with various tools:

- IDV, the NSF Unidata Integrated Data Viewer, which provides capabilities for 3D analysis and visualization of disparate datasets.
- AWIPS CAVE, the data rendering and visualization tool used by the US National Weather Service and many university programs to work with meteorological data from AWIPS EDEX.
- Python-awips, a package providing a data access framework for requesting meteorological and related datasets from AWIPS EDEX.
- MetPy[cite:@may2016metpy][cite:@metpy], a collection of tools in Python for reading, visualizing, and performing calculations with weather data.

*** Containerization Efforts
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-4CE9CC8E
:END:

The cloud computing era of the last two decades has enabled access to powerful and specialized computing resources that scale almost infinitely with the possibility of access to large scientific datasets facilitating big data analysis and visualization[cite:@ansari2018]. The arrival of Jetstream[cite:@10.1145/2792745.2792774] in 2015 provided NSF Unidata a unique avenue to take advantage of cloud computing capabilities not available on commercial cloud providers due to prohibitive costs or time limited grants that did not offer long-term continuity. At that time, NSF Unidata applied for a Start Up grant via XSEDE[cite:@10.1109/MCSE.2014.80] to obtain resources for exploration of Jetstream's features.

NSF Unidata began its investigations of cloud computing on Jetstream by containerizing traditional NSF Unidata software and experimenting with them. We developed containerized versions of the LDM, THREDDS, and RAMADDA serving large quantities of observational and forecast model ESS data[cite:@Chastang2016]. With the aid of a subsequent, much larger XSEDE Research allocation, these efforts allowed us to employ Jetstream as a demonstration server and a testing platform to ensure NSF Unidata containerized applications were working correctly for distribution to our community. This process was made possible through container registries like DockerHub. Later on, in collaboration with the NOAA Big Data Project and Amazon Web Services (AWS), NSF Unidata deployed a THREDDS AWS Nexrad Server on the Jetstream Cloud[fn:1]. More than twenty years of Nexrad Level II radar data are available from this server. The data reside on AWS, but are served out by a THREDDS Data server running on Jetstream2 facilitated by an Internet2 arrangement between the two clouds.

*** Evolution and Impact of JupyterHub Technology in NSF Unidata Community: From Inception to Present
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-7AB9A6D1
:END:

In 2014, Fernando PÃ©rez and Brian Granger created Jupyter (originally IPython) notebook technology[cite:@Kluyver:2016aa]. Jupyter notebooks excel at interactive, exploratory scientific programming for researchers and their students. With their mixture of prose, equations, diagrams and interactive code examples, Jupyter notebooks are particularly effective in educational settings and for expository objectives[cite:@Perkel:2018aa]. Their use has become prevalent in many scientific disciplines including atmospheric science[cite:@Arms2020b]. JupyterHub enables specialists to deploy pre-configured notebook servers, typically in cloud computing settings. With JupyterHub, users log in to arrive at their own notebook workspace. The advantages of deploying a JupyterHub in a cloud computing environment are numerous. JupyterHub prevents users from having to download and install complex software that can be difficult to configure properly. They can be provisioned with computational resources not found in a desktop computing setting and take advantage of high speed networks for processing large datasets. JupyterHub servers can be accessed from any web browser-enabled device including laptops and tablets. In sum, they greatly improve "time to science" by removing the complexity and tedium required to establish a notebook environment.

In 2017, after observing the potential that Jupyter technologies could provide our community, NSF Unidata sought assistance from the XSEDE ECSS[cite:@4be80a98eb09448fa2ef0e98ed52ad37]  program to bring JupyterHub to Jetstream in a manner that could accommodate many users by employing Kubernetes cloud computing technology. We first collaborated with Semir Sarajlic (Georgia Tech) and later Andrea Zonca (SDSC) to port the "Zero to JupyterHub with Kubernetes" project to Jetstream[cite:@Sarajlic2018a][cite:@Zonca2020a]. As a result of these accomplishments, NSF Unidata launched a demonstration server in 2017 and started offering customized, pre-configured JupyterHub servers for workshops and classrooms in 2018. After these initial milestones, requests for JupyterHub servers started arriving quickly for semester-long classes and summer internships at UCAR. Demand for these resources accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic with the shift to online learning[cite:@Ramamurthy2021a]. We have provided access to customized Jupyter notebook environments to more than 1,830 students across 24 universities and via many workshops at venues such as the American Meteorological Society annual meeting[cite:@Chastang2024a]. The majority of these students are undergraduates in atmospheric science.

*** AWIPS EDEX
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-5A4ABA45
:END:

AWIPS (Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System) is a weather forecasting display and analysis package developed for the National Weather Service by Raytheon Technologies Corporation. AWIPS consists of three main components: the visualization tool CAVE (Common AWIPS Visualization Environment), the backend server EDEX (Environmental Data Exchange system), and python-awips, a programmatic data access API. NSF Unidata develops, tailors, repackages, and redistributes AWIPS to the academic community for educational and research applications.

#+NAME: AWIPS
#+CAPTION: /2023 EDEX Users in the Academic Atmospheric Science Community[cite:@Meyer2023a]/

file:awips.png

NSF Unidata has hosted a publicly-accessible EDEX server since 2017 on Jetstream. With the ever-increasing amount of data, the server system has been expanded to three EDEX machines for a complete EDEX system. These three machines work together to ingest, process, and serve a wide array of data in real time to the community. Further, in 2020, an additional EDEX system was created and has been used as a development and live backup server to the production system. Both systems are positioned behind a load balancer that functions as a DNS relay, facilitating seamless redirection between the two systems.

In the summer of 2022, these machines were rebuilt and transitioned over to the new Jetstream2 platform. Since the completion of that work, the AWIPS team has also stood up a second set of EDEX systems to support development on a newer version of AWIPS.

At the end of 2023, a new set of EDEX machines were rolled out, this time on a different operating system (transitioning from CentOS7 to Rocky8). With the idea that more EDEX machines would be launched based on this new OS, the group at Unidata decided to create a default rocky8 image with the default packages, rpms, users, configurations, mounts, etc. installed to make the creation of a new EDEX system more streamlined and faster. This deployment process has been thoroughly documented to ensure its utility for future use.

The availability to have different OSâs and development versus production systems on Jetstream resources has allowed the NSF Unidata AWIPS team to easily test new functionality and enables a seamless transition between AWIPS builds, with no downtime for the community. Over 80 academic institutions use our EDEX servers for CAVE and python-awips. NSF Unidata's EDEX servers provide real-time weather data to our community, who use AWIPS in classroom and research settings.

In 2020, we released an asynchronous eLearning course covering the fundamentals of CAVE. This course was designed for new users of CAVE, including undergraduate meteorology students at universities, and provides demonstrations, tutorials, activities, assessments, and challenges using CAVE functionality by connecting to NSF Unidata's EDEX server on Jetstream2. In 2022, we developed a similar, smaller eLearning course to introduce our users to the basics of python-awips. This course also relies on our public EDEX systems on Jetstream2.
